**ðŸš€ FIFO Queue Implementation for Rate Limiting Prevention**

This PR introduces a centralized First-In-First-Out (FIFO) request queue system to prevent API rate limiting issues when fetching data from external sources like Binance and Quidax.

**Problem Solved:**
- Multiple concurrent API requests were triggering rate limiters on external APIs (HTTP 429 errors)
- 79+ currency sources making simultaneous requests every 5-10 minutes caused service disruptions
- Application crashes due to unhandled rate limiting responses

**Solution:**
- **Centralized RequestQueue**: Singleton pattern ensuring all API requests go through a single queue
- **2-second delay**: Minimum delay between requests to respect API rate limits
- **FIFO processing**: Requests are processed in the order they were received
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of queue processing errors without crashing the application

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Located in: src/rates/sources/source.ts
class RequestQueue {
  private static instance: RequestQueue;
  private queue: Array<() => Promise<any>> = [];
  private processing = false;
  private lastRequestTime = 0;
  private minDelayBetweenRequests = 2000; // 2 seconds
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/rates/sources/source.ts` - Added RequestQueue class and queuedRequest method
- `src/rates/sources/binance.source.ts` - Refactored to use queued requests
- `src/rates/sources/quidax.source.ts` - Refactored to use queued requests

**Impact:**
- âœ… Eliminates rate limiting errors (HTTP 429)
- âœ… Ensures reliable data fetching from external APIs
- âœ… Maintains application stability under high load
- âœ… Backward compatible - no breaking changes to existing API

**FIFO Queue Testing:**

**Manual Testing Steps:**
1. **Start the application**: `npm run start:dev`
2. **Monitor logs**: Watch for rate limiting errors (should be eliminated)
3. **Test multiple currency endpoints simultaneously**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/rates/usdt/ngn &
   curl http://localhost:8000/rates/usdt/usd &
   curl http://localhost:8000/rates/usdc/eur &
   ```
4. **Verify queue behavior**: Check that requests are processed with 2-second delays
5. **Load testing**: Make rapid API calls to ensure queue handles burst traffic

**Expected Results:**
- No HTTP 429 (rate limiting) errors in logs
- All requests processed successfully with appropriate delays
- Application remains stable under concurrent load
- Data fetching continues reliably for all 79+ supported currencies

**Environment:**
- Node.js v22.17.0
- NestJS v10.x
- TypeScript 5.x
- macOS/Linux development environment
